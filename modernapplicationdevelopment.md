# Modern Application Development

Invention requires two things: the ability to try a lot of experiments, and not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments.

## Why? Rapid Innovation
Companies are looking to become more agile so they can innovate and respond to change faster. This requires a different kind of application than what was common years ago. Applications now need to scale quickly to potentially millions of users, have global availability, manage petabytes if not exabytes of data, and respond in milliseconds. We call these modern applications, and they cover use cases from web and mobile backends, IoT applications, AI/ML workloads, batch processing, PaaS solutions, microservice backends, and more. Modern applications are built with a combination of these new architecture patterns, operational models, and software delivery processes, and they allow businesses to innovate faster while reducing risk, time to market, and total cost of ownership.

## Benefits of modern application development
#### 1 Faster to market
By speeding up the release cycle and offloading operational overhead, developers can quickly build new features. Automated test and release processes reduce error rates, so products are market-ready faster.

#### 2 Increased innovation
With a modular architecture, changes to any individual application component can be made quickly, and with a lower risk to the whole application, so teams can experiment with new ideas more often.

#### 3 Improved reliability
By automating test procedures, and monitoring at every stage of the development lifecycle, modern applications are reliable at deployment. Any issues can be evaluated and addressed in real time.

#### 4 Reduced costs
With a pay-for-value pricing model, modern applications reduce the cost of over-provisioning or paying for idle resources. By offloading infrastructure management, maintenance costs are also lower.

## What is Serverless?
AWS defines Serverless by 4 criteria:

#### 1 No server management
There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer. 

#### 2 Flexible scaling
Your application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (e.g. throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.

#### 3 Pay for value
Pay for consistent throughput or execution duration rather than by server unit.

#### 4 Automated high availability
Serverless provides built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default.
