A core domain is a domain where 
- your organization is making a strategic investment in software
- its among the highest priority projects
- your organization must excel at in software
- how your organization distinguishes itself from all others

A supporting domain is:
- necessary to support the core domain
- it requires custom development because an off the shelf product does not exist
- this software does not deserve the kind of investment the core domain gets
- consider outsourcing to avoid heavy investment

A generic domain is:
- necessary, but generic
- avoid investing heavily in this software
- may be possible to purchase as off the shelf product, or be outsourced
- if developed in-house, do not assign developers with elite skills, such as with core domain team
