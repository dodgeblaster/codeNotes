We need to be a company that can pivot.

As individuals, we need to care about finding the truth, even if it contradicts our own opinions.
Infact, we should hav a healthy distance between our opinions, because they are transitory, and a healthy desire to be
close to the truth.

This means, we should be able to recognize when we are wrong and pivot personally, quickly, and with no drama.

If we as individuals value this in ourselves, then we have a chance to emulate it as a company.

As a company, we need to find the truth, about market fit, or experiments. Find the truth quickly,
and pivot quickly with as little ceremony as possible.

We should be able to pivot on a daily basis on things we are responsible for without a big conversation,
red tape, or long vetting precedures.

If the data reveals the truth, that should be enough to pivot instantly.
